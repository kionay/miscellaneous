# Misc. Repository

Here are things that I wanted to be on my github.
Each of these probably don't need their own little repositories.

## a numbers game

A mastermind clone using the cli for a UI.

## hashtagify rank

Calling hashtagify on various words (or many words in a paragraph) to get and rank them by how popular they are.
Put in a blog post, get out suggestions for what to tag it with when you share the post on twitter.

## memcheck

A little tool I made to help explain how memory works to someone.
When talking about bits and bytes, datatypes, and memoy consumption it's hard to visualize this "memory" thing.

memcheck outputs memory locations, strings of bytes as binary, their decimal representation, and if applicable the character associated with that character code.
